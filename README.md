Remove mitigations from (running!) software.

This library detects and removes spectre mitigations from a (running) program
by disassembling it, pattern matching for any calls that use trampolines, and rewriting
them to ordinary calls.

Currently WIP.

Support
-------

- [x] Linux 64bit
- [ ] Linux 32bit
- [ ] Windows 64bit
- [ ] Windows 32bit

Removes
-------

- [x] indirect calls via retpolines (Spectre v1 mitigation)
- [x] returns via return thunks (Spectre v1 mitigation)
- [ ] return address checks

Build
-----

```
mkdir build
