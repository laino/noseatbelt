==========

Remove mitigations from (running!) software.

This library detects and removes mitigations (Spectre, CFG, ...) from a running program and also applies some optimizations.

Currently WIP.

Transformations
---------------

Currently the following transformations are applied:

- [x] indirect calls via retpolines to direct calls (Spectre mitigation removal)
- [x] returns via return thunks to direct returns (Spectre mitigation removal)
- [x] Control Flow Guards removed (Windows CFI)
- [ ] Control Flow Guards removed (LLVM and others)
- [ ] Return Flow Guards removed
- [x] inlining of JMP instructions (to RET or JMP)
- [x] redirecting of CALL instructions (to JMP or another CALL)
- [ ] inlining of functions

Support
-------

- [x] Linux 64bit
- [ ] Linux 32bit
- [x] Windows 64bit
- [ ] Windows 32bit

Build
-----

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../ #Release is default
make
```

Usage
-----
